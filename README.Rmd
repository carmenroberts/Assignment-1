## Hello Octocat

I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

## Exploring Anscombe Dataset

```{r, quick look, echo=FALSE}
data("anscombe")     # indicate that you are using the dataset "anscombe"
dim(anscombe)        # dimensions of dataframe (number of rows and columns)
names(anscombe)      # names of the columns and rows
head(anscombe, n=6)  # contents of first six lines
tail(anscombe, n=6)  # contents of last six lines
summary(anscombe)    # summary statistics for each column
```

## Scatter Plot of Anscombe Dataset

```{r xy_plot, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', dev='svg'}
data("anscombe")            # indicate that you are using the dataset "anscombe" 
plot(anscombe$x1, anscombe$y1)        #plotting scatter plot of columns x1 and y1
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))  #adding abline showing linear regression
```

```{r data_import, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/analgesic.csv")    
```

## Exploring Analgesic Dataset

```{r data_summary, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data("df")     # indicate that you are using the dataset "df"
dim(df)        # dimensions of dataframe (number of rows and columns)
names(df)      # names of columns and rows
head(df, n=6)  # contents of first six lines
tail(df, n=6)  # contents of last six lines
summary(df)    # summary statistics for each column
```

## Tidying of Analgesic Dataset

```{r data_tidy, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
g <- gather(df, "Measurement", "n", Measurement_1:Measurement_3) #tidying data from wide to long format
s <- summarise(group_by(g, ID), mean(n))  #summarising data by calculating mean for each individual
print(s)                                  #print data
```

## Chicken Weights
**Null Hypothesis:** Chicken feed does not have an effect on the growth of chickens

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Chicken feed does have an effect on growth of chickens

For an unpaired parametric data set, a one-way ANOVA is required to test the hypothesis.

```{r chick_weights, echo=TRUE}
df_chicken <- read.csv("chick-weights.csv")             #import data set
boxplot(weight ~ feed, data = df_chicken)               #create boxplot
chicken_anova <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = df_chicken)  #one-way ANOVA 
summary(chicken_anova)                                  #summay statistics
```

p-value = 5.94e-10 ; F-value = 15.37

The p-value is smaller than the F-value, therefore we reject the null hypothesis.
We can therefore conclude that chicken feed does have an effect on chicken weights.

## The Hot zone
**Null Hypothesis:** The contamination of the drinking water did not cause the gastroenteritis outbreak

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The contamination of the drinking water did cause the gastroenteritis outbreak

For an unpaired, non-parametric and categorical data set, a Fishers exact test will be used to test the hypothesis. 

Significance interval set at 95%, reject null hypothesis if p<0.05. Therefore we reject our null hypothesis.

We conclude that the contamination caused severe gastroenteritis.

```{r hot_zone, echo=TRUE}
df_gastro <- read.csv("gastroenteritis.csv")                #import data set
df_table <- table(df_gastro$Consumption, df_gastro$Outcome) #create table
df_table                                                    #print the table

hot_test <- fisher.test(df_table)     #Fisher's test to test hypothesis
print(hot_test)                       #print the table
```
p-value = 2.2e-16

## Nausea
**Null Hypothesis:** The 5HT3-receptor blocker does not reduce nausea in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The 5HT3-receptor blocker does reduce nausea in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy

Data is paired, parametric and ordinal. McNemar's Chi-Square test is required to test the hypothesis.

Significance interval set at 95%, reject null hypothesis if p<0.05. Therefore we reject our null hypothesis.

We conclude that the 5HT3-receptor blocker does reduce nausea in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

```{r nausea, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_nausea <- read.csv("nausea.csv") #import data set
nausea_new <- df_nausea[-8, -1]     #data cleaning by excluding observation 8
nausea_new                          #call new table created
boxplot(nausea_new)                 #creating boxplot
wilcox.test(nausea_new$Nausea_before, nausea_new$Nausea_after, paired=TRUE)                                          #wilcox rank-sum test to test hypothesis
```

p-value = 0.04983
