## Hello Octocat

I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

## Anscombe Dataset

```{r, quick look, echo=FALSE}
data("anscombe")     # indicate that you are using the dataset "anscombe"
dim(anscombe)        # dimensions of dataframe (number of rows and columns)
names(anscombe)      # names of the columns and rows
head(anscombe, n=6)  # contents of first six lines
tail(anscombe, n=6)  # contents of last six lines
summary(anscombe)    # summary statistics for each column
```

```{r xy_plot, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', dev='svg'}
data("anscombe")            # indicate that you are using the dataset "anscombe" 
plot(anscombe$x1, anscombe$y1)        #plotting scatter plot of columns x1 and y1
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))  #adding abline showing linear regression
```

```{r data_import, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/analgesic.csv")  #import analgesic dataset  
```

## Analgesic Dataset

```{r data_summary, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data("df")     # indicate that you are using the dataset "df"
dim(df)        # dimensions of dataframe (number of rows and columns)
names(df)      # names of columns and rows
head(df, n=6)  # contents of first six lines
tail(df, n=6)  # contents of last six lines
summary(df)    # summary statistics for each column
```

```{r data_tidy, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
g <- gather(df, "Measurement", "n", Measurement_1:Measurement_3) #tidying data from wide to long format
s <- summarise(group_by(g, ID), mean(n))  #summarising data by calculating mean for each individual
print(s)                                  #print data
```


## Chicken Weights

**Null Hypothesis:** Chicken feed does not have an effect on the growth of chickens

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Chicken feed does have an effect on growth of chickens

**Assumptions:** For an unpaired parametric data set, a one-way ANOVA is required to test the hypothesis.

#

```{r chick_weights, echo=TRUE}
df_chicken <- read.csv("chick-weights.csv")             #import data set
boxplot(weight ~ feed, data = df_chicken)               #create boxplot
chicken_anova <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = df_chicken)  #one-way ANOVA 
summary(chicken_anova)                                  #summay statistics
```

p-value = 5.94e-10 ; F-value = 15.37

**Conclusions:** 

The p-value is smaller than the F-value, therefore we reject the null hypothesis. We can therefore conclude that chicken feed does have an effect on chicken weights.



## The Hot Zone

**Null Hypothesis:** The contamination of the drinking water did not cause the gastroenteritis outbreak

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The contamination of the drinking water did cause the gastroenteritis outbreak

**Assumptions:** For an unpaired, non-parametric and categorical data set, a Fishers exact test will be used to test the hypothesis. 

Significance interval set at 95%, reject the null hypothesis if p<0.05. 

```{r hot_zone, echo=TRUE}
df_gastro <- read.csv("gastroenteritis.csv")                #import data set
df_table <- table(df_gastro$Consumption, df_gastro$Outcome) #create table
df_table                                                    #print the table

hot_test <- fisher.test(df_table)     #Fisher's test to test hypothesis
print(hot_test)                       #print the table
```
p-value = 2.2e-16

**Conclusions:** 

p<0.05, therefore we reject our null hypothesis.We conclude that the contamination caused severe gastroenteritis.



## Nausea

**Null Hypothesis:** The 5HT3-receptor blocker does not reduce nausea in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The 5HT3-receptor blocker does reduce nausea in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy

**Assumptions** Data is paired, parametric and ordinal. Wilcox rank-sum test is required to test the hypothesis.

Significance interval set at 95%, reject null hypothesis if p<0.05. 

```{r nausea, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_nausea <- read.csv("nausea.csv") #import data set
nausea_new <- df_nausea[-8, -1]     #data cleaning by excluding observation 8
nausea_new                          #call new table created
boxplot(nausea_new)                 #creating boxplot
wilcox.test(nausea_new$Nausea_before, nausea_new$Nausea_after, paired=TRUE)                                          #wilcox rank-sum test to test hypothesis
```

p-value = 0.04983


**Conclusions:** 

p<0.04, therefore we reject our null hypothesis.
We conclude that the 5HT3-receptor blocker does reduce nausea in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.



## Housing Prices

**Null Hypothesis:** The interest rate does not affect the housing prices

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The interest rate does affect the housing prices

**Assumptions for Pearson's Correlation:** Interest rate and housing price (USD) are on an interval scale. There are no outliers. The variables (Interest Rate and Housing Prices) are normally distributed.

**Assumptions for Linear Regression:** There is a linear trend between Interest Rate and Housing Prices. The obsevartions are independent and Interest Rate is measured without error. The residuals are nomally  distributed and they have the same  variance for all fitted values of y. The residuals is homoskedastic.

```{r housing-prices, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

#Import dataset
df_houses <- read.csv("housing-prices.csv")

#Plot the data
plot(df_houses$interest_rate, df_houses$median_house_price_USD, 
     main = "Relationship between Interest Rate and Housing Prices",
     xlab = "Interest Rate (%)",
     ylab = "Housing Prices (USD)",
     xlim = c(5,10), ylim = c(150000,330000))

#Pearson's Correlation test
house_test <- with(df_houses, cor.test(x = interest_rate, y = median_house_price_USD, method = 'pearson'))
house_test 

#Linear Regression
house_reg <- lm(median_house_price_USD~interest_rate, data = df_houses)

#Add linear regression line
abline(house_reg)

#Check for Homoskedasticity
homo_house <- plot(x = house_reg$fitted, y = house_reg$residuals) 
abline(h = 0)

#Check for Gaussian residual distribution/ normality                    
qqnorm(house_reg$residuals)
qqline(house_reg$residuals) 

#Summary of data
summary(house_reg)

```

r = -0.4458286 


**Conclusion:** 

Therefore we reject our null hypothesis. We conclude that high interest rates is associated with low housing prices.

The residuals are normally distributed as their distribution fits on the normal Q-Q plot. 

The residuals are homoskedastic as they show spread around the zero abline.
